# Lab Structure Rules

## Section Organization

- **Group related tasks**: Organize tasks into logical sections by topic or operation type
- **Consolidate answers**: Place all answers together at the end of each section, not scattered under individual tasks
- **Answer format**: Use "### Answers for Section X:" followed by all commands for that section
- **Task format**: List tasks as bullet points under each section, not as individual numbered headings

## Task Ordering

- **Logical flow**: Order tasks so readers can perform them smoothly one by one
- **Avoid conflicts**: Don't ask to "read a file" after deleting it
- **Follow CRUD pattern**: Consider Create, Read, Update, Delete operations as a guide
- **Ensure dependencies**: Make sure prerequisite tasks come before dependent tasks

## Content Requirements

- **Complete coverage**: Include every command, operation, and concept from the source material
- **Hands-on focus**: Create practical tasks, not just theoretical questions
- **Clear instructions**: Make each task actionable and specific
